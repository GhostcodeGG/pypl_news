# Ghostcode

This project now includes an automated PayPal news digest generator.

## Setup

1. Create and populate a Python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or export the variables manually) and provide your [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) key:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Usage

Run the digest generator locally:

```bash
python -m paypal_digest --verbose
```

Digests are saved to `data/digests/` by default and printed to the console. Previously processed articles are tracked in `data/state.json` to prevent duplicate summaries across runs.

## Scheduling

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/daily-digest.yml`) is configured to execute the digest every day at 09:00 UTC. Provide a repository secret named `NEWSAPI_KEY` so the workflow can access premium sources. The workflow uploads the generated digest as an artifact for later review.
